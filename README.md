# cipher-trader
Electron React App for making and managing crypto exchange trades



### GOALS:
* Desktop implementation of [BitMEX-scaled-orders repo](https://github.com/Effanuel/BitMEX-scaled-orders) but with multiple exchange support;
* Moving complicated order placing logic to websocket to increase speed (like trailing and cross order);
* Maybe somehow integrate with [SignificantTrades](https://github.com/Tucsky/SignificantTrades)


### Motivation:
* This future tool is supposed to be the only place you would go to to place orders on Desktop
   * If you see yourself using your phone to make trades, I highly recommend **TabTrader** (only Android for trade placement);
* I am making this tool for fun, don't expect anything amazing.

### TODO:
* a lot...
